DiskStress
----------



Here is a mini tool to stress a bit your hard drive. I made it while trying to figure out an issue on my sata drive, turned out the connector was faulty.

Anyhow the usage is pretty straightforward:

	diskstress  tmp_folder  number_of_cycles  number_of_files_by_cycle  [file_max_size_mb]

Use it at your ease, but if the tool finds a use in your day to day workflow (who knows!) don't hesitate to send a little mail :)
